# AI Agent - a boot.dev project

boot.dev AI agent course that uses python to create an AI agent that can edit code directly and communicate with Google Gemini.

---

## Extending the Project

You've done all the required steps, but have some fun (but carefully... be very cautious about giving an LLM access to your filesystem and python interpreter) with it! See if you can get it to:

- Fix harder and more complex bugs
- Refactor sections of code
- Add entirely new features

You can also try:

- Other LLM providers
- Other Gemini models
- Giving it more functions to call
- Other codebases (Commit your changes before running the agent so you can always revert!)

Remember, what we've built is a toy version of something like Cursor/Zed's Agentic Mode, or Claude Code. Even their tools aren't perfectly secure, so be careful what you give it access to, and don't give this code away to anyone else to use.
